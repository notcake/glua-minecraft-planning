# StaTech Industry 1.1.11 Changelog:

Added back Sodium and Iris this patch since the zipping of the MI datagen files last update forces a manual review on Curseforge anyway. Discussion for the large 1.2.0 patch has started in the Discord. It will mainly focus on lategame progression and changes around the space age and components of that.
